# 🎓 EasyExchangeConnect 🎓

## Overview

***EasyExchangeConnect*** is a full-stack web application platform developed to streamline the Erasmus student exchange application process by connecting *young professionals* (students, YP), *experts* (university alumni), and administrators through a centralized, modern system.

The goal of EasyExchangeConnect is to replace the tediousness of the current application process with a simpler and more direct procedure through:
-    A student-side component for submitting and tracking Erasmus applications
-    An administrator-side portal to manage home university-partnered institutions and review applications
-    Automated approval/rejection process via email notifications
-    An AI-powered assistant (Yinka) to guide users through the platform
-    A collaborative sector of the platform *EasyExchangeConnect+*

The focus on reusability, scalability and real-world relevance makes this product suitable for academic and institutional use.
